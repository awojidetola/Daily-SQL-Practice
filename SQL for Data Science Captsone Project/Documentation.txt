Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. 	Business : 	primary key - id (10000 distinct records), 
ii. 	Hours : 	foregin key - business_id (1562 distinct records)
iii. 	Category : 	foreign key - business_id (2643 distinct records)
iv. 	Attribute : 	foregin key - business_id (1115 distinct records)
v. 	Review:		primary key - id (10000 distinct records), foreign key - business_id (8090 distinct records), foreign key - userid (9581 distinct records)
vi. 	Checkin:	primary key - business_id (493 distinct records)
vii.	Photo:		primary key - id (10000 distinct records), foreign key - business id (6493 distinct records)
viii. 	Tip: 		foreign key - business_id (3979 distinct records), foreign key - user_id (537 distinct records)	
ix. 	User:		primary key - id (10000 distinct records)
x	Friend:		foreign key - user_id (11 distinct records)
xi.	Elite_years:	foreign key - user_id (2780 distinct records)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

+------------------------+--------------+------------+
(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)

Based on the table above - and with further analysis of the result, there is no significant relationship between the number of reviews and the fans.
The number of fans is likely an effect of the quality of the review and the how much the fans relate to it.


9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
There are 1780 reveiws with the word "love" in them and only 232 reviews with the word "hate" in them.
So, there are more reveiws with the word "love" than those with the word "hate" in them.
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT 
  COUNT (text) 
FROM 
  review 
WHERE 
  LOWER(text) LIKE '%love%';


SELECT 
  COUNT (text) 
FROM 
  review 
WHERE 
  LOWER(text) LIKE '%hate%';

	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  fans 
FROM 
  user 
ORDER BY

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

The city selected is Las Vegas and the category selected is Shopping. 

+-----------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+----------+----------+----------------------+--------------+
| city      | address                     | postal_code | avg_stars | category | COUNT(*) | hours                | total_review |
+-----------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+----------+----------+----------------------+--------------+
| Las Vegas | 3808 E Tropicana Ave        | 89121       |       2.5 | Shopping |        7 | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |           42 |
| Las Vegas | 3421 E Tropicana Ave, Ste I | 89121       |       3.5 | Shopping |        6 | Saturday|10:00-16:00 |           66 |
| Las Vegas | 1000 Scenic Loop Dr         | 89161       |       4.5 | Shopping |        7 | Saturday|8:00-16:30  |          224 |
| Las Vegas | 3555 W Reno Ave, Ste F      | 89118       |       5.0 | Shopping |        5 | Monday|8:00-17:00    |           20 |
+-----------+-----------------------------+-------------+-----------+----------+----------+----------------------+--------------+


i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
There is no significant difference between the distribution of hours between the two groups.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, in total, the 4-5 group have a total review of 244 while that of the 2-3 group have a total review of 108.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Locations at the postal_code 89121 are in the review group 2-3.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
  b.city AS city, 
  b.address, 
  b.postal_code, 
  AVG(b.stars) AS avg_stars, 
  c.category AS category, 
  COUNT(*), 
  h.hours, 
  SUM(b.review_count) AS total_review 
FROM 
  business AS b 
  LEFT JOIN hours AS h ON b.id = h.business_id 
  LEFT JOIN category AS c ON b.id = c.business_id 
WHERE 
  c.category = 'Shopping' 
  AND b.city = 'Las Vegas' 
GROUP BY 
  b.stars 
ORDER BY 
  b.stars;


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

+---------------+-----------+--------------+
| open_or_close | avg_stars | total_review |
+---------------+-----------+--------------+
| close         |      3.52 |        35261 |
| open          |      3.68 |       269300 |
+---------------+-----------+--------------+
	
i. Difference 1: Businesses that are open have a slightly higher star rating on average than businesses that are close
          
ii. Difference 2: There are more review for businesses that are open than for those that are close.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'open' ELSE 'close' END AS 'open_or_close', 
  ROUND(
    AVG(stars), 
    2
  ) AS avg_stars, 
  SUM(review_count) AS total_review 
FROM 
  business 
GROUP BY 
  open_or_close;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
Predicting Customer Acceptance (Ratings)

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

A customers view helps a business owner to know how well they are performing and what they should improve on. In this analysis the following variables are considered:
review count, time range(opening and closing time), day of week, category to predict the rating category (as low or high). 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+-----------+-------+------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------------+
